Currently there is also an issue with pre-commit lint loading the wrong version of node leading to an
Exec format error. (note that this is not occurring for the test-pkg)

When building wheels for python 3.8, numpy version 1.24.4 is used and on import throws and error that
generate_rng is not found. Should resolve this and include support for python 3.7
